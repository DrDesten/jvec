# jvec

`jvec` is a lightweight JavaScript library for working with 2D, 3D, and 4D vectors. It provides classes `vec2`, `vec3`, and `vec4` for vector operations, making it easy to perform mathematical computations in graphics programming, physics simulations, and other applications requiring vector arithmetic.
